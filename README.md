## Introduction
This Virtual Internship is a simulation of a business case similar to what KPMG faces daily.   
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd (fictional company), a medium-size bikes & cycling accessories organization, need help to find meaningful insights in their datasets. These insights are useful for marketing to better target the adversting campaigns on new customers.  
  
The structure of the project is divided into three main tasks:
1. Data Quality Assessment
2. Data Insights
3. Data Insights and Presentation
  
### Datasets
The datasets shared are in an Excel file, in different sheets. These datasets are:
1. **Transactions** --> customer transactions in a certain range of dates
2. **CustomerDemographic** --> the customer features like "gender", "job title", "job_industry", etc..
3. **CustomerAddress** --> the customers' address and the property valuation
4. **NewCustomerList** --> new customers with features and addresses

## Task 1 - Data Quality Assessment
The goal of this task is to inspect the various datasets to assess the quality of data. You have to draft an email to the client with recommendations on how to mitigate the issues and clean data.  
  
In the folder [Task_1](../../tree/master/Task_1), you can find the Jupyter Notebook used to assess the client's data and the email draft.

## Task 2 - Data Insights
  
  
In the folder [Task_2](../../tree/master/Task_2), you can find the Jupyter Notebook used to assess the client's data and the email draft.
